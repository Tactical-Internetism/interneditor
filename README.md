In the 50s, Jane Jacobs wrote about the beauty of her nook of New York City, Greenwich Village, and the importance of peoples' everyday
influence on the culture of the neighborhood. Today, we see cultural and aesthic elements of Greenwich Village imported into cities 
around the world by designers, entreprenuers, city planners, and gentrifiers. However, these imports come without the soul that so 
inspired Jacobs and are often imposed to the detriment of local and historic cultures that already exist in a place. A vibrant and
sustainable culture cannot be imported. It must be created, collectively and progressively, by the residents of a place.

In 2020, we are concerned about a similar phenomenon arising in digital spaces. On a web where minimalism reigns, colors exist only in 
palates, and the average user has limited to no agency to manipulate their spaces, what does the future of internet culture look like? If 
users cannot create, reshape, and hack the spaces they use, how can we create vibrant and sustainable internet cultures that are
diverse, interesting, and representative of the people who participate in them?

**Inspired by tactical urbanists who seek to reconfigure physical spaces to change how they work and are percieved, Tacitical Internetism
seeks to develop new tools to create and expereince the internet that diminish the divide between user and creator.**
